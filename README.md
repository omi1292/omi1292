# Cuisine Quest – 🌍 Android App for International Recipes

## 📱 Overview
Cuisine Quest is a recipe discovery Android app that helps users explore famous dishes from different countries. 
Includes filters, estimated cooking time, and interactive features like “Like” and “Share” to enhance user experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Java, XML (Android Studio)
- Firebase Authentication & Realtime Database

## 🌟 Key Features
- 🌐 Filter by country to explore global cuisines
- ⏱️ Displays estimated cooking time for each recipe
- 👍 Like and 🔁 Share buttons to boost user engagement
- 🔒 Firebase for secure user authentication & data storage
- 🎯 Clean, responsive UI designed for smooth navigation

## 🚀 Why it Stands Out
- Combines culture + technology in a user-focused mobile app
- Built with scalable architecture and real-time sync
- Demonstrates practical use of UI/UX, backend integration, and Android development

## 📸 Screenshots (Optional)
Include screenshots of:
- Home screen
- Recipe detail screen
- Country filter
- Like/share buttons
